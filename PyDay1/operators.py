# python operators work like most programming languages

a = 10 + 10  # add
b  = 100 - 40 # subtract
c = 5 * 4 # multiply
d = 10/2 # divide

e  = 4 ** 2 # 4 to the power of 3

f = 10//3 # floor division operator output is 20
g = 10%3 # modulous gets the remainder

print(10//3)

#comparsion operators
x = 100
y = 100
x == y # is equal to (different than is) the value is the same
x != y # not equal to
x < y # less than
x > y # greater than
x >= y # greater than or equal to
x <= y # less than or equal to

# logical operators

x == y and (y < 100 or y ==9)

# is the letter g in a string
"g" not in "string" # this true

# python has a really weird ternary that I am not a fan of
x = "Hello" if  4<5 else "world"
print
