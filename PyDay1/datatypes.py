# Python has quire a few data types. it considers it's collection ( think list or array or dictionary)
#numberic types
i = 100 # of type int (integer type)
ii: int = 100 #

f = 100.7 # of type float ( decimal values)
ff: float = 1986.5

#text
s = " hello guys" # text and string, there is no char type in python

ss: str = " ehll" # type annotation


#Boolean types
t = True # True or False
f = False #
tt: bool = True

 #None Type, Python does not have null instead it has None, very similiar to null and functionally identical in most ways
n = None

 # to find the type of something there is an in built type function
print(type(ii)) # any of the types above can be checked here in
